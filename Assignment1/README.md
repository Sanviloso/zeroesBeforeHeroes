#This is my first Assignment with zeroesBeforeHeroes

In this course I learnt about:
    1. The Command Line Interface (CLI)


    2. *Software Development lifecycle (SDLC) basics* 


* *What is SDLC?*

SDLC is like a roadmap for building software.

✅ _*It's a step-by-step process that helps developers create software that meets the user's needs.*_

* *Why do we need SDLC?*

Imagine building a house without a plan. 
You might end up with a house that's not what you wanted or has many problems.

✅ *SDLC helps developers avoid mistakes, saves time and money, and ensures that the software is of high quality.*

* What are the steps in SDLC?

Here are the basic steps:

1. *Planning*: Define what the software should do and who will use it.
2. *Requirements Gathering*: Collect information about what the user needs.
3. *Design*: Create a blueprint of the software.
4. *Implementation* (Coding): Write the code for the software.
5. *Testing*: Check if the software works correctly.
6. *Deployment*: Release the software to the public.
7. *Maintenance*: Update and fix the software as needed.

*SDLC Models*
There are several SDLC models, including:

1. *Waterfall*: A linear approach where each step is completed before moving to the next.
2. *Agile*: A flexible approach that involves continuous improvement and iteration.
3. *V-Model*: A testing-driven approach that emphasizes verification and validation.

*Key Takeaways*
- SDLC is a structured approach to software development.
- It helps developers create high-quality software that meets user needs.
- SDLC involves planning, requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
